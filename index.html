        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>I changed career paths in 2017. Working as an Intresmuntation Technician I was ask if I wanted to
            take a Comp-TIA A+ class, because they had an extra seat availble. To my surprise, and everyone elses I devowded 
            the class and material. I wanted to learn as much as I could about computers.
            A year later I started to learn about virtualization and VMware. VMware really launched my career in IT.</p>
        <h4>VMware</h4>
        <p>With VMware I learned as much as I could.  I was given the oppurtunity to upgrade my current work's environment back in 2018.
            I also had a home lab that I worked on. Mostly learning hardware and infrastructure. In 2021 I got a job with Cobb County Government
            managing their entire virtualization environment.
        </p>
        <h4>Kennesaw State University</h4>
        <p>Working at Cobb County I enrolled at Kennesaw State University (KSU) in 2021 to work towards a Bachelors of Science in IT.
            I was not good with Math and started with remedial level classes.  I didn't let that discourage me. I kept moving forward.  
            The entire time, working full time, and being a full time dad.
            In 2022 I was awarded Deans List for having above a 3.5 GPA.  Through my studies I have started to shift away from learning 
            infastructure and focusing more on coding and application development.  Through work I was enrolled in the Development Training Program
            for Cobb County.  
            So far my joruney has been an experience. I enjoy every minute of it, well maybe not learning C#!
